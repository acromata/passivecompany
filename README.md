A remake of Lethal Company, made in 72 hours

# Woah, you're stealing Lethal Company?? >:(

Yeah, this is a lethal company remake I made in 72 hours for a personal gamejam, it is nothing alike the official game, it only works in single player, there's 4 scrap items and only 1 enemy. 
# Fire in the hole???

Yeah, there's a lot of refrences, I kind of went mentally insane during the ending so you may find a lot of random stuff, including a secret room :)
